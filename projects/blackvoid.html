            <h1>Blackvoid.io</h1>
            <p class="bread">Blackvoid was a project that was heavily inspired by the popular browser game Agar.io. The difference in this game was adding an element of gravity, and you instead of being cells would be massive black holes that consumed planets and systems around you. </p>
            <p class="bread">
                You would have special abilities, which you could use to either escape or bait other players around you. You would also have options to customize your black hole, with different powerups, or simply cosmetically, for example, you could be a black hole with a red accretion disc instead of a purple one.
            </p>
            <p class="bread">
                The game would also have achievements you could try to accomplish and as well an in-game currency to buy powerups for.
